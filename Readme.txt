# Bike Sharing Analysis Data Dashboard

This is a comprehensive project for analyzing bike sharing data using various data science tools and techniques. 
The project includes a Streamlit dashboard for interactive data visualization, a Jupyter Notebook for detailed data analysis, and a Python script for running the analysis. 
It also includes a `requirements.txt` file for easy installation of dependencies.

## Description

The Bike Sharing Analysis Data Dashboard provides insights into bike sharing usage patterns, trends, and predictions. The project leverages Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## usage
To run the Streamlit dashboard, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the name of your Streamlit application file if it is different.
